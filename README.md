# QuickPay SDK Example app

The QuickPay SDK Example app demonstrates how to uses the [QuickPay SDK](https://github.com/QuickPay/ios-sdk) to accept payments through QuickPay.


## Setup

This example app is already set up with a test account and API key, so you can download it and run it as is. You can also just look through the code to get some inspiration for your own development.

## Apple Pay

Since Apple Pay needs to be setup with an Apple developer account, this payment method cannot be tried out of the box.

To get Apple Pay up and running you will need your own account from QuickPay and an Apple developer account. You can follow the guide from the [QuickPay SDK repo](https://github.com/QuickPay/ios-sdk) in order to create a valid certificate for accepting Apple Pay payments.
